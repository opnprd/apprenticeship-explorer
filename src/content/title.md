The __Apprenticeship Explorer__ allows you to delve into the
[Apprenticeship data](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/apprenticeships-and-traineeships-july-2019)
published by The Department for Education. It's a work in progress at present, so
[feedback is welcomed](https://github.com/opnprd/apprenticeship-explorer/issues/new) (free GitHub account

The number presented is an estimate of the number of apprentices active during academic year 2017/18. This
is the last full academic year for which we have data. The calculation method is rough at the moment, and
derived by the following method:

* It's assumed that apprenticeships are 3 years long
* All active apprentices in the year started in the current and prior two years
* An estimate of dropout rates can be made by taking figures for a year and calculating the number
  of achievements in three year's time.
* The active population comprises the sum of 3 years adjusted by the dropout rate.

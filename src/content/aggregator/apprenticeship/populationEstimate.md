The number presented is an estimate of the number of apprentices active during academic year
2017/18. This is the last full academic year for which we have data. The calculation method
is rough at the moment, and derived by the following method:

* It's assumed that apprenticeships are 3 years long
* All active apprentices in the year started in the current and prior two years
* An estimate of dropout rates can be made by taking figures for a year and calculating the number
  of achievements in three year's time.
* The active population comprises the sum of 3 years adjusted by the dropout rate.
